## Post-Retro Improvement Workflow

> **The AI must execute this workflow immediately after the retro document is complete. Do not wait for the engineer to initiate it.**

### Step 1 — Synthesise findings into improvement proposals

Read every entry in "What Didn't Go Well", "AI-Specific Observations", and "Actions". For each finding that points to a fixable rule, skill, or guideline, draft one improvement proposal covering:
- Which file needs to change (`ai-dlc/rules/`, `ai-dlc/skills/`, `ai-dlc/guidelines/`, or the master rule file)
- The exact current text to replace (or "new addition" if nothing exists yet)
- The exact proposed replacement text
- Why the change prevents the finding from recurring

Present all proposals to the engineer as a numbered list — one proposal per finding — before creating any files.

### Step 2 — Engineer review

For each proposal, the engineer approves, rejects, or asks for revision. Record the decision next to each item. Do not proceed to Step 3 until all proposals have a decision.

### Step 3 — Create improvement files and apply changes

For each approved proposal:
1. Create an improvement file at `ops/operate/improvements/YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md` using the template
2. Apply the change directly to the target file
3. If the master rule file was changed, update all mirror files in the same pass (see Step 8 of the setup guide)
4. Set the improvement status to **Applied** and record the date

### Step 4 — Update this retro

Update the "Improvements Triggered" table above with the improvement file links and mark each as Applied or Rejected. Close the retro only after all approved improvements are applied.
