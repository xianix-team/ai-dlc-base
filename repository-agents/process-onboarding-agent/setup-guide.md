# AI-DLC Setup Guide

This document explains how to set up the AI-DLC framework in a repository. It works with Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Everything here is generic — substitute your project's technology stack, domain terms, and rules where indicated.

---

## Framework Root (`{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}`)

Throughout this guide, `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}` refers to the installation path determined during the **Preliminary Step** of `process-onboarding-agent/onboard.md`. It is set to:

- `{existing-docs-folder}/intent-execution-framework` — if the engineer has an existing process/docs folder, or
- `docs/process/intent-execution-framework` — if no such folder exists yet

All files created by this guide are placed under `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/`. Do not create any framework files under `process-onboarding-agent/` — that folder is the bootstrap agent and is deleted after onboarding.

---

## What You Are Building

AI-DLC is a structured operating system for building software with AI assistance. It is not a tool — it is a set of files, conventions, and ceremonies that govern how your team and your AI work together. The output is a repo where:

- Every feature starts with a written intent and testable acceptance criteria
- Every AI interaction is gated by a quality check and logged for audit
- Every failure feeds back into rules that prevent recurrence
- Any engineer (or AI tool) opening the repo knows exactly how to work in it

---

## Before You Begin

### Question 1 — Which AI tool are you using?

This guide uses the term **master rule file** to refer to the file that governs AI behaviour in your repository. Each tool has a different name and location for this file:

| AI Tool | Master rule file | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | Repo root |
| **Cursor** | `.cursorrules` | Repo root |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/` folder |

The content of the master rule file is identical across tools. The only differences are the file name, the location, and — for GitHub Copilot — internal links to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/` files must use the prefix `../{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/` since the file lives inside `.github/`.

All subsequent steps in this guide refer to the "master rule file." Substitute the correct name and path for your chosen tool.

> If you want to support more than one AI tool in the same repo, write the master rule file once and create copies for each additional tool. See Step 8.

---

### Question 2 — Fresh or Mature Project?

Before following this guide, the AI must ask the engineer one question:

> **"Is this a fresh project (no significant codebase yet) or a mature project (existing code, conventions, and team practices already in place)?"**

- **Fresh project** → proceed directly to Step 1 below.
- **Mature project** → complete the Mature Project Onboarding phases (Phase M1–M3) first, then continue to Step 1.

---

## Mature Project Onboarding

Onboarding AI-DLC into an existing codebase requires three preparatory phases before any Bolt is written. The goal is to extract what the system already is, encode it as rules, and establish safety controls — so that AI-DLC enhances the project without disrupting what already works.

---

### Phase M1 — Codebase Archaeology Analysis

#### M1.0 — Scope Agreement (Required Before Any Analysis)

Large codebases cannot be analysed in a single context window. Before reading any code, the agent must ask the engineer to define the analysis scope.

Ask the engineer:

> "This codebase may be too large to analyse in one pass without overloading context. To keep each analysis pass focused and accurate, I'd like to work through it in segments.
>
> Please tell me:
> 1. Which modules, services, or folders are the highest priority for AI-DLC onboarding?
> 2. Are there any areas I should skip entirely for now (e.g. legacy code not being actively worked on, third-party code, generated files)?
> 3. Should I analyse one segment at a time and report findings before moving to the next, or would you prefer a summary across all agreed segments?"

Record the engineer's answers. Use them to define **analysis segments** — named, bounded slices of the codebase (e.g. "auth service", "payments module", "shared UI components"). Each segment is analysed independently across M1.1–M1.4, with findings reported to the engineer before moving to the next segment.

**Rules for segmented analysis:**
- Never read beyond the agreed segment boundary in a single pass
- After completing each segment, present a findings summary and ask the engineer to confirm before continuing to the next segment
- If a segment itself is too large for one context window, ask the engineer to break it down further before proceeding
- Keep a running segment log: `Segment | Status | Key findings` — update it after each segment completes

Only proceed to M1.1 once at least one segment is agreed.

#### M1.0-P — Parallel Archaeology (Optional)

After segments are agreed, offer the parallel option:

> "You have [N] segments to analyze. I can work through them one by one in this session, or — if other engineers are available — each person can run the analysis for their segment independently on their own machine and share a structured report back to you. Running segments in parallel has two advantages:
>
> 1. **Speed** — all segments are analyzed simultaneously rather than sequentially.
> 2. **Accuracy** — engineers who work in a specific module every day will surface patterns and risks that a cold analysis might miss. Independent findings that match across sessions have higher confidence than single-session findings.
>
> Would you like to run this archaeology in parallel? If yes, I'll give you a segment assignment brief for each engineer to copy to their own session."

If the engineer says **yes**:

1. Produce a **Segment Assignment Brief** for each segment — a short block the engineer can paste into another AI session to kick off a parallel analysis. Format:

   ```
   Segment Assignment: [Segment name]
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   You are running a codebase archaeology analysis for one segment of a larger project.
   Your scope is limited to: [folders/modules]
   Do not read outside this boundary.

   Run phases M1.1, M1.2, M1.3, and M1.4 from process-onboarding-agent/setup-guide.md for this segment only.
   When complete, produce a Segment Report using the format defined in Phase M1.5 of the setup guide.
   The engineer will copy your Segment Report back to the main session for synthesis.
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ```

2. Assign each segment to an engineer. If the number of engineers is fewer than the number of segments, assign multiple segments to one engineer — they run them sequentially in their session.

3. Tell the main engineer:

   > "Share each brief with the assigned engineer. When each parallel session is complete, paste its Segment Report back here. I'll run Phase M1.5 to synthesize all reports into the final archaeology output."

4. Pause the main session's M1.1–M1.4 analysis — do not begin reading code in the main session. The main session resumes at Phase M1.5 once all Segment Reports are received.

If the engineer says **no**, proceed directly to M1.1 in the current session.

---

#### M1.1 — Architecture Mapping

- Read the codebase module by module (within the agreed segment)
- Generate business-language descriptions of each module (what it does, not how)
- Produce a capability map: what the system does as a whole
- Identify service boundaries, integration points, and data flows
- Output becomes the foundation for the Bolt Backlog

#### M1.2 — Pattern Extraction

- Read 10–20 representative files across modules
- Extract: naming conventions, error handling style, ORM usage, API response shapes, authentication patterns, test patterns and coverage conventions
- Document all extracted patterns — these go into the master rule file and the `rules/` folder before any Bolt is written

#### M1.3 — Due Diligence Audit

Before classifying work, audit the existing codebase for defects and structural problems that new AI-generated code could inherit. This step must complete before any Bolt is planned.

**What to look for:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Logic defects** | Incorrect business logic, off-by-one errors, wrong conditional branches, silent data loss |
| **Design violations** | Responsibilities mixed across layers, circular dependencies, God classes or functions doing too much |
| **Security gaps** | Unvalidated input, missing auth checks, secrets in code, direct DB calls from the wrong layer |
| **Fragile patterns** | Catch-all error suppression, hardcoded values that should be config, mutable shared state |
| **Test blind spots** | Code paths with no test coverage; tests that assert implementation details rather than behaviour |
| **Consistency breaks** | Naming or structural conventions that differ across modules with no documented reason |

**Output:** A ranked list of findings. For each finding, record:
- Location (file/module/function)
- Category from the table above
- Impact if inherited by new code
- Recommended correction (fix-in-place, quarantine, or encode as a prohibition in the master rule file)

Present the list to the engineer and agree on which items must be corrected before the first Bolt runs and which can be logged as Remediation Bolts.

#### M1.4 — Debt and Gap Mapping

Classify all identified work — including findings from M1.3 — into three Bolt types:

| Bolt Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enhancement Bolt** | New capabilities not yet in the system |
| **Remediation Bolt** | Tech debt, coverage gaps, refactoring, and defects found in M1.3 |
| **Migration Bolt** | Architectural changes that enable future work |

**Prioritisation order:** Remediation of blocking defects found in M1.3 first → Enhancement (shows value) → Remediation of non-blocking debt → Migration last.

---

#### M1.5 — Parallel Synthesis (Only runs if M1.0-P parallel mode was chosen)

This phase runs in the **main session** once all parallel engineers have returned their Segment Reports. Do not start synthesis until every assigned segment has a report.

##### Segment Report Format

Each parallel session must produce a report in this exact structure so the main session can parse and synthesize it consistently:

```markdown
# Segment Report: [Segment name]

**Analyst:** [Engineer name]
**AI tool:** [Claude Code / Cursor / GitHub Copilot]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** [folders and modules covered]
**Confidence:** High / Medium / Low
(High = engineer is very familiar with this module;
 Medium = some familiarity;
 Low = cold analysis only, no domain knowledge applied)

---

## M1.1 — Architecture

[Business-language description of each module in scope. What it does, not how.]

**Service boundaries identified:**
- [boundary description]

**Integration points:**
- [integration description]

**Data flows:**
- [flow description]

---

## M1.2 — Patterns Extracted

| Pattern type | Observed convention | Example location |
|---|---|---|
| Naming | [convention] | [file/module] |
| Error handling | [convention] | [file/module] |
| API response shape | [convention] | [file/module] |
| Auth pattern | [convention] | [file/module] |
| Test pattern | [convention] | [file/module] |
| ORM / DB access | [convention] | [file/module] |

---

## M1.3 — Due Diligence Findings

| # | Location | Category | Description | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [file/function] | [category] | [description] | [impact] | Fix-in-place / Quarantine / Encode as prohibition |

---

## M1.4 — Debt Classification

| Work item | Bolt type | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [description] | Enhancement / Remediation / Migration | High / Med / Low | [notes] |

---

## Confidence Notes

[Anything the analyst was uncertain about, code paths not covered, or areas where a second opinion is recommended.]
```

##### Synthesis Protocol

Once all Segment Reports are received:

**Step 1 — Validate completeness.** Check that every agreed segment has a report. If any segment is missing, do not proceed — ask the engineer to follow up with the assigned analyst.

**Step 2 — Merge architecture findings.** Combine the M1.1 sections across all reports into a single capability map. Identify: modules that appear in multiple reports (cross-segment dependencies), integration points that span segment boundaries, and data flows that pass through more than one segment.

**Step 3 — Reconcile patterns.** For each pattern type in M1.2, compare findings across reports:

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Same convention found in 2+ segments | Mark as **Confirmed convention** — high confidence for the master rule file |
| Different conventions found for the same pattern type | Mark as **Inconsistency** — flag to engineer for resolution before writing rules |
| Convention found in only one segment | Mark as **Unconfirmed** — note the segment scope and treat with lower confidence |

**Step 4 — Consolidate due diligence findings.** Merge all M1.3 findings into a single ranked list. Apply a confidence boost to any finding that appears in more than one report independently — these have been confirmed by multiple analysts without coordination and are high-priority. Flag any finding where two reports directly contradict each other (e.g. one reports a pattern as consistent, another reports it as absent) — these require engineer resolution.

**Step 5 — Unify debt classification.** Merge all M1.4 items. De-duplicate by description. Where two analysts classified the same work item differently (e.g. one called it Remediation, another called it Migration), present both classifications to the engineer and ask for a decision.

**Step 6 — Present the synthesis report.** Before proceeding to Phase M2, present:

```
Parallel Archaeology Synthesis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Segments analyzed:    [N] of [N] assigned
Analysts:             [names]
Combined confidence:  [summary]

Confirmed conventions:     [N]  (found in 2+ segments independently)
Inconsistencies to resolve: [N]  (conflicting findings — need engineer decision)
High-confidence findings:  [N]  (due diligence items confirmed by 2+ analysts)

Items needing engineer resolution before Phase M2:
  [list each inconsistency or conflict with both positions stated]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Resolve all conflicts with the engineer before writing any Phase M2 files. Then continue to Phase M2 using the synthesized output as the archaeology result.

---

### Phase M2 — Repository Overlay

Create the governance layer on top of the existing codebase. All four artefacts must exist before the first Bolt runs.

#### M2.1 — Master Rule File

The most important file in the overlay. See **Before You Begin** for the correct file name and location for your AI tool. Must contain:
- Architecture context derived from M1.1
- Coding conventions extracted in M1.2
- Forbidden zones (see M2.2)
- Bolt workflow rules
- Entry points (see M2.3)

Follow the full master rule file authoring instructions in Step 2 of this guide, but populate each section from the archaeology output rather than from scratch.

#### M2.2 — Forbidden Zones

Create `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/guidelines/forbidden-zones.md` containing an explicit list of files, modules, or patterns that the AI must **not** modify without senior engineer approval. This protects stable, business-critical code from accidental change.

```markdown
| Zone | Path / Pattern | Reason | Approval required from |
|---|---|---|---|
| <name> | <path or glob> | <why it is protected> | <role> |
```

Reference this file in the master rule file under Code Rules (Section 3) so it is enforced in every session.

#### M2.3 — Entry Point Registry

Create `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/guidelines/entry-points.md` containing the approved list of modules and features where AI-DLC Bolts may begin. This controls the expansion boundary. Update the list as the team gains confidence with the process.

```markdown
| Module / Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <name> | Approved / Pending / Blocked | <any constraints> |
```

#### M2.4 — Coding Conventions File

Create `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/code-standards.md` (or populate it if it already exists) entirely from the patterns extracted in M1.2. Every AI session must match the style of the existing codebase — this file is the authoritative source injected into each session.

---

### Phase M3 — Blast Radius Management

Before any Bolt is executed, three safety controls must be in place. These apply to every Bolt that touches existing code.

#### M3.1 — Test Coverage Gate

Verify that adequate test coverage exists for the target feature or module before a Bolt begins. If coverage is insufficient, a Remediation Bolt to add tests must be planned and executed first. No Bolt modifying existing code starts without this gate passing.

#### M3.2 — Feature Flag Requirement

Every change introduced by AI-DLC into an existing module must be wrapped in a feature flag. This limits production impact if a change behaves unexpectedly and allows rollback without a deployment.

#### M3.3 — Default Acceptance Criterion for Existing-Code Bolts

Every Bolt that affects existing code must carry the following AC by default. It has two forms depending on Bolt classification:

**Standard form** (Enhancement Bolts and all Bolts not classified as Migration or Remediation):
> **"All integration tests for [affected module] pass without modification."**

This AC is non-negotiable and cannot be removed during elaboration.

**Contract-change form** (Migration Bolts and Remediation Bolts that explicitly change contract boundaries — e.g. API shapes, data schemas, inter-module interfaces):
> **"All integration tests for [affected module] pass without modification, except for tests that cover the contract boundaries listed as breaking changes below. Each breaking change must be detailed and approved in the elaboration session before any code is generated."**

When the contract-change form applies, the elaboration session must produce a **Breaking Changes Register** — a table attached to the unit file listing every changed contract boundary, the reason it must change, and the name of the engineer who approved it. No unit using the contract-change form may be executed without a completed and approved Breaking Changes Register.

Add both forms to the master rule file Section 6 (AI-DLC Workflow) and to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/code-standards.md` so the correct form is enforced automatically based on Bolt classification.

---

### Mature Project Onboarding Checklist

Once all items above are checked, continue to **Step 1** of this guide to create the full folder structure and remaining artifacts.

---

## Fresh Project — Structured Interview

For fresh projects the agent cannot read a codebase to populate the master rule file. Instead, it must run a structured interview before creating any files. The interview is strictly one question at a time, in this order. The agent must not proceed to the next question until the engineer has answered the current one.

**Do not present all questions at once. Ask them one at a time and wait for the answer.**

---

**Interview sequence:**

1. **Product identity**
   > "In one sentence, what does this product do and who uses it?"

2. **Technology stack — backend**
   > "What language and framework will the backend use? (e.g., Node/Express, Python/FastAPI, .NET/ASP.NET Core)"

3. **Technology stack — frontend**
   > "What language and framework will the frontend use? (e.g., React/TypeScript, Vue, server-rendered only)"

4. **Database and auth**
   > "What database will you use, and how will authentication work? (e.g., PostgreSQL with Supabase Auth, MongoDB with JWT)"

5. **System boundaries**
   > "Are there any hard rules about what must never happen architecturally? (e.g., 'the frontend must never call the database directly', 'the mobile app communicates only through the REST API')"

6. **Domain language**
   > "List the key business terms this system uses — the words that appear in your domain, not generic tech terms. For each one, give a one-sentence definition. (e.g., 'Booking — a confirmed reservation between a guest and a host')"
   >
   > *Keep asking "any more?" until the engineer says done.*

7. **Known constraints and prohibitions**
   > "Are there any technical choices that are already decided and must not be changed by the AI? (e.g., 'we must use REST, not GraphQL', 'no ORM — raw SQL only', 'all prices stored as integers in cents')"

8. **First capability**
   > "What is the first feature or capability you want to build? Give it a name and one sentence describing what it does for the user."

9. **Documentation archive threshold**
   > "AI-DLC generates operational documents over time (retros, improvement files, unit files, bolt files). These can be compacted and archived periodically using the compact-docs skill. How many months old must a document be before it qualifies for archiving? (Common choices: 3, 6, or 12 months. This can be changed later.)"

---

Once all nine questions are answered, the agent has enough to:
- Create the folder structure (Step 1)
- Write the master rule file with Sections 1–5, Section 8, and Process Configuration fully populated
- Write an initial first intent file from the answer to question 8
- Flag Sections 6 and 7 (workflow and review) as pre-populated from the guide defaults

---

## Step 1 — Create the Folder Structure

Create this directory tree at the root of your repository:

```
{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/

      incidents/             ← one file per production issue
        _template.md
      improvements/          ← one file per process change triggered by retro/incident
        _template.md
```

---

## Step 2 — Write the Master Rule File (The Behavioral Contract)

The master rule file is loaded automatically by your AI tool every session. See **Before You Begin** for the correct file name and location for your tool — the content is the same regardless of which tool you use. Every section below is required.

> **Path substitution — critical:** Every template block below contains the placeholder `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}`. When writing the actual master rule file, replace every occurrence of `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}` with the real path determined in the Preliminary Step of `process-onboarding-agent/onboard.md`. For example, if `FRAMEWORK_ROOT` = `docs/process/intent-execution-framework`, then `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/prompt-quality-gate.md` must be written as `docs/process/intent-execution-framework/rules/prompt-quality-gate.md`. The master rule file must contain real, resolvable paths — never the literal string `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}`.

### Section 1 — Project Identity

State what the system is and its technology stack. Be specific — the AI needs to know:
- What the product does (one sentence)
- Backend language/framework and key patterns
- Frontend language/framework
- Database and auth approach
- **System boundaries** — what calls what; what must never happen (e.g. "frontend never calls the database directly")

```markdown
## 1. Project Identity

**<ProjectName>** is a <one-sentence description>.
- Backend: <language/framework, key patterns>
- Frontend: <language/framework>
- Database: <database, auth approach>

**System boundaries:**
- <boundary rule 1>
- <boundary rule 2>
```

### Section 2 — Prompt Quality Gate

A two-line routing entry. Do not embed the gate definition — it lives in `rules/prompt-quality-gate.md`.

```markdown
## 2. Prompt Quality Gate

Before every code response: read and enforce `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/prompt-quality-gate.md`.
If any of the four components (Context · Constraints · Acceptance Criteria · Output Format) is missing, stop and ask for it. Do not generate code.
```

### Section 3 — Code Rules

Three to five **hard-stop prohibitions** that the AI must have in working memory (no file lookup tolerated) — these are the rules where a single violation causes immediate, serious harm. Then a mandatory-read routing line for everything else.

```markdown
## 3. Code Rules

**Hard stops — memorise, never look up:**
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or connection strings
- Never trust client-supplied IDs without server-side ownership verification
- Never expose internal stack traces to the client
- [1–2 stack-specific absolute prohibitions from the project interview]

**Full rules (read before writing any code):**
- Conventions and patterns: `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/code-standards.md`
- Security rules: `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/security.md`
- Architecture decisions: `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/architecture.md`
```

Keep the hard-stop list to five items maximum. Anything beyond five belongs in `code-standards.md`, not here.

### Section 4 — Domain Language

A mandatory-read instruction plus the two or three terms most likely to cause logic errors if misused. The full glossary lives in `guidelines/domain-glossary.md` — do not reproduce it here.

```markdown
## 4. Domain Language

Read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/guidelines/domain-glossary.md` before every elaboration session and before generating any business logic. Use only the terms defined there — do not substitute synonyms.

**Critical terms (load immediately):**
- **[Term]:** [one-line definition]
- **[Term]:** [one-line definition]
```

Limit inline terms to three. If the project has more critical terms, add them to the glossary file, not to this section.

### Section 5 — Known Edge Cases

A single mandatory-read routing line. No inline table — edge cases are added continuously via the retro loop and must stay in their dedicated file to remain current.

```markdown
## 5. Known Edge Cases

Read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/guidelines/edge-cases.md` before generating code for any unit. Do not skip this step — new edge cases are added after every retro.
```

### Section 6 — AI-DLC Workflow

The turn structure is short enough to hold in working memory — keep it inline. Everything else routes to files.

```markdown
## 6. AI-DLC Workflow

**Session start check:** At the beginning of every session, present the following note to the engineer:
> "At any point during this session, if you have a question about a step, need further clarification, or don't have the exact answer to a question I'm asking — just say so. I'll help you work through it so we don't get blocked."

Then read the `Next dependency audit` date from Section 9. If today is on or after that date, prompt the engineer before any other work:
> "A dependency and security audit is scheduled. Would you like to run it now, or set a new date?"
If the engineer defers, ask for the new date and update Section 9 before continuing.

**Elaboration turn structure (strictly one unit per turn):**
1. Propose one unit — name and one-sentence purpose only. Stop.
2. Propose ACs as a numbered list. Stop.
3. Surface edge cases and open questions. Stop.
4. Ask the three observability questions: what confirms this is working in production? What log entry signals failure? What alert threshold makes sense? If the answer represents code behavior, add it as an AC. If not applicable, record "Not applicable" and move on. Stop.
5. Move to next unit. Repeat.
6. After all units agreed, present summary table and ask for sign-off before writing any files.

**Solution shaping:** at the start of every mob elaboration, check the intent for a `## Solution Shape` section. If it is absent and the intent introduces a new capability, a potentially reusable surface, or an expensive-to-reverse decision, ask the engineer once whether to run `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/solution-shaping.md` first or proceed straight to design. The engineer decides — run it, skip it, or invoke it directly at any time; never block on it. Skip the prompt entirely for plainly small, feature-specific intents.
**Full elaboration protocol (including design session):** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/mob-elab-prompts.md` before every elaboration session. The design session runs as Phase 0 of elaboration — it is not invoked separately.
**Bolt risk assessment:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/bolt-risk-assessment.md` after elaboration sign-off and before the first unit in a bolt executes. No unit may begin execution without a signed-off risk assessment in the bolt file.
**UAT skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/uat.md` when all units under an intent are marked Done, or when the engineer invokes it directly. Prompt the engineer to run UAT before setting intent status to Implemented.
**Progress digest skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/progress-digest.md` when the engineer asks for a stakeholder update, progress summary, or digest for an intent.
**Process health skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/process-health.md` when the engineer invokes it to audit how well the AI-DLC process is functioning.
**New engineer induction skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/new-engineer-induction.md` when an engineer says they are new to the project or invokes it directly.
**Knowledge promotion skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/knowledge-promotion.md` as Step 5 of the Post-Retro Improvement Workflow after all improvements are applied. A retro is not closed until every Applied improvement has a Knowledge Promotion status.
**Dependency audit skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/dependency-audit.md` when the engineer invokes it, or when the `Next dependency audit` date in Section 9 has been reached. Prompt at session start if the date is due.
**Process health skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/process-health.md` when the engineer invokes it to audit how well the AI-DLC process is functioning.
**Compact-docs skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/compact-docs.md` when the engineer invokes it.
**Root-cause-analysis skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/root-cause-analysis.md` when the engineer invokes it, or when an incident is marked Resolved and no RCA has been run on it.
**Bug bolt:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/bug-bolt.md` when the engineer says "fix a bug", "there's a bug in X", or "bug: [description]". Do not run a full mob elaboration — follow the bug bolt workflow directly.
**Hotfix bolt:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/hotfix-bolt.md` when the engineer says "hotfix", "production issue", "prod is down", or "emergency fix for X". Skip elaboration — begin hotfix intake immediately.
**NFR bolt:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/nfr-bolt.md` when the engineer says "improve performance", "harden security", "accessibility improvements", "NFR bolt for X", or "non-functional work on X". Do not create a new intent — follow the NFR bolt workflow.
**Engagement monitoring:** read and apply `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/engagement.md` throughout all ceremonies.
```

### Section 7 — Review Behavior

A single routing line. The checklist lives in its file.

```markdown
## 7. Review Behavior

Before presenting any output, run every item in `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/review-checklist.md`. Do not present output that has not passed this checklist.
```

### Section 8 — Reference Map

A table mapping common needs to their files. Engineers and the AI both use this to navigate the framework.

### Section 9 — Process Configuration

A single table of project-level process settings that govern AI-DLC behaviour. Populate from the setup interview answers. Every value here can be changed by the project lead at any time by editing this section.

```markdown
## 9. Process Configuration

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Archive threshold** | [X] months | Documents older than this qualify for archiving via the compact-docs skill |
| **Last dependency audit** | — | Updated automatically each time the dependency-audit skill runs |
| **Next dependency audit** | YYYY-MM-DD | AI prompts at session start on or after this date; default interval is 30 days |
```

The archive threshold is read by the `compact-docs` skill at runtime. If this section is absent, the skill will ask the engineer for the value before proceeding.

The dependency audit dates are read and written by the `dependency-audit` skill. The `Next dependency audit` date is checked at the start of every session — if today is on or after that date, the AI prompts the engineer to run the audit before any other work begins. Set this value during onboarding by asking the engineer:

> "When would you like to schedule the first dependency and security audit? The recommended interval is once a month."

---

## Step 3 — Write the Rules Files

### `rules/prompt-quality-gate.md`

Defines the four components in detail with examples of complete and incomplete requests. Include:
- What each component means
- The order to ask for missing components
- An example of an incomplete request and the correct response
- An example of a complete request

### `rules/code-standards.md`

Document your stack's patterns and anti-patterns. Key sections:
- Languages & runtimes
- Naming conventions (per language)
- Framework patterns (backend and frontend)
- Formatting & linting tooling
- Testing requirements and coverage thresholds

**Critically:** add anti-patterns discovered through actual failures — e.g. framework methods that look correct but have unit-testing limitations. These turn retro findings into permanent rules.

### `rules/security.md`

Two sections:
- **Never do these** — injection, auth gaps, secrets, data exposure
- **Always do these** — input validation, auth on every endpoint, least privilege

Add a section for your specific platform's security quirks (e.g. Supabase RLS, AWS IAM patterns, OAuth flows).

### `rules/architecture.md`

One ADR per significant decision. Format:

```markdown
### ADR-001 — <Decision title>
**Decision:** <what was decided>
**Why:** <the reasoning>
**Trade-off:** <what you gave up>
```

Add an ADR whenever a new cross-cutting decision is made — especially ones where the AI might make a different choice if not told (e.g. symmetric vs asymmetric JWT signing, SSR vs SPA, monorepo vs polyrepo).

### `rules/engagement.md`

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/rules/engagement.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/engagement.md`. It defines two monitoring protocols: (1) engineer disengagement signals — when to intervene, what to say, and how to handle continued non-engagement; (2) failed output circuit breaker — if AI output for the same unit is rejected 3 consecutive times with the same underlying failure, execution stops, a diagnostic question is asked, and the outcome is recorded in the unit's Prompt Log. The master rule file Section 6 routes to it with a single mandatory-read line — do not inline its contents.

---

## Step 4 — Write the Skills Files

> **Path substitution — critical:** Any `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}` placeholder that appears in the content descriptions below (or in "Wire into the master rule file" snippets) must be replaced with the actual resolved path before writing. This applies to generated skills files (`mob-elab-prompts.md`, `review-checklist.md`) and to any routing lines added to the master rule file Section 6. Skills files that are copied verbatim (compact-docs, root-cause-analysis, design-session, uat, etc.) do not contain `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}` and require no substitution.

### `skills/mob-elab-prompts.md`

The mob elaboration reference. Must include:
- **Solution Shape check (before anything else):** at the very start of every elaboration session, read the intent and check for a `## Solution Shape` section. If it is missing and the intent introduces a new capability, a potentially reusable surface, or an expensive-to-reverse decision, ask the engineer once:

  > "This intent has no recorded solution shape. Run Solution Shaping first (`{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/solution-shaping.md`) to decide generic-vs-specific, simplest-viable, and extend-vs-build — or proceed straight to design?"

  The engineer decides: run it (then resume elaboration with the recorded shape as binding context), or proceed as-is. Never block. For plainly small, feature-specific intents, skip this prompt and go straight to mode selection.
- **Elaboration Mode Selection:** at the very start of every elaboration session, before Phase 0, ask the engineer which mode they prefer:

  > "Before we begin — which elaboration mode would you like to use?
  >
  > **A — Interactive (turn-by-turn):** I'll propose one unit at a time, confirm the ACs with you, then move to edge cases and observability before proposing the next. Good for working through uncertain scope.
  >
  > **B — Plan-first:** I'll draft a complete elaboration plan — all proposed units with ACs, edge cases, and observability signals — as a single markdown document. You review it, mark changes, and we refine from there. Good when you have a clear picture and want to see everything at once."

  Record the answer. **Mode A** follows the standard turn-by-turn protocol described below. **Mode B** follows the plan-first protocol:
  1. Run Phase 0 (design session) as normal.
  2. Produce the full draft plan as a markdown document written to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/inception/elaborations/YYYY-MM-DD-<unix_timestamp>-[intent-slug]-draft-plan.md`. The document contains: intent recap, all proposed units (each with context, ACs, scope boundaries, edge cases, and observability signals), and a unit summary table.
  3. Ask the engineer to review and respond with any changes, additions, or removals.
  4. Apply changes in a second pass — update the draft document and confirm the revised unit summary table with the engineer.
  5. Proceed to sign-off and the Dependency Map update as normal once the engineer confirms the plan is complete.

  The quality gate, ACs, and sign-off requirements are identical in both modes — Mode B compresses the back-and-forth into a document review cycle, it does not skip any step.

- **Phase 0 — Design Session:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/design-session.md` and run it at the opening of every session before proposing any units. The design session scopes the intent's API surface, data model, and architectural patterns, then produces binding constraints that govern every unit and AC in the session. For simple intents with nothing new to design, Phase 0 concludes quickly and flows straight into unit decomposition. If the intent carries a `## Solution Shape` section (recorded by `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/solution-shaping.md` before elaboration), Phase 0 treats those decisions as binding context and designs within them.
- The mandatory interactive protocol (turn structure + never-do rules)
- Facilitation prompts for: proposing units, proposing ACs, edge case check, observability check (success signal / failure signal / alert threshold per unit), generating implementation scaffold, reviewing output
- **Post sign-off — Dependency Map update:** after the engineer confirms sign-off on the unit summary table and before writing any files, read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/inception/dependency-map.md` and update it: record any prerequisites this intent has on other intents, and any shared interfaces (API contracts, data entities) that cross intent boundaries. Add a row to the Update Log. If a dependency on an incomplete intent is found, flag it to the engineer before proceeding.

### `skills/review-checklist.md`

Structured review sections covering all five AI failure modes:

| Section | Failure mode covered |
|---|---|
| Functional Correctness | Logic errors that look correct |
| Code Quality | Over-engineering; dead code |
| Security | Security vulnerabilities |
| Architecture | Architectural drift |
| Tests | Logic errors; hallucinations |
| AI-Specific Checks | Hallucinated library calls; prompt log; scope creep |
| Observability | Missing production evidence; silent failures |
| Deployment Readiness | Configuration errors; breaking changes |

Key items that must be present:
- Feature verified in a real environment — tests passing alone is not sufficient
- Nothing in the diff beyond what the ACs required (no extra abstractions or future-proofing)
- Diff checked against system boundaries in `architecture.md`
- Behavioral trade-offs confirmed before accepting output
- For wrapper/layout components: existing files grepped for patterns the new component will duplicate before generation
- Observability section of the unit file is complete — success signal, failure signal, and alert threshold are recorded; any that represent code behavior are expressed as ACs and implemented in the diff
- Any AC asserting a page/route is "accessible" is verified by a rendered 200 (following redirects) with the expected content actually visible — text present and legible, images decoded (non-zero natural dimensions) — never a build pass or a 3xx redirect alone
- After any deploy, a post-deploy smoke suite passes against the live deployed URL, asserting key pages render their actual content (text visible, images decoded, primary auth/entry reachable) rather than merely returning a 200 status — a deploy is not done until this passes
- Before pushing changes that CI or any shared pipeline will check, the full local verification gate (typecheck, lint, format, tests, build, and any other CI step) passes — not just the command that changed
- Unit-test coverage is reviewed for each bolt: pure/logic code (validators, helpers, transforms, formatters) has unit tests, or it is explicitly stated that the bolt added no unit-testable logic (integration/rendering/DB-backed code belongs in the project's E2E harness, not unit tests)
- Verification gates (e.g. a post-deploy smoke suite) are run by whoever is driving the work — when an AI assistant is driving a deploy, the assistant runs the gate itself and reports the result, rather than handing a runnable check back to the engineer

### `skills/compact-docs.md`

The compact-docs skill is engineer-triggered and must never run automatically. It archives operational documents older than the project's configured threshold to keep the active workspace manageable without losing institutional memory.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/compact-docs.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/compact-docs.md`. No customisation is needed — the archive threshold is read from the master rule file Process Configuration section at runtime.

### `skills/root-cause-analysis.md`

The root-cause-analysis skill applies structured 5-Whys analysis to resolved incidents and filed improvements to find deeper root causes beyond the immediate fix. It classifies findings into three categories — Solution Design, Technology Selection, and Process — and produces recommendations that map directly to new intent files, ADRs, or improvement files.

Can operate on a single file or across a batch to surface cross-cutting patterns and recurring vulnerabilities.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/root-cause-analysis.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/root-cause-analysis.md`. No customisation is needed.

### `skills/solution-shaping.md`

The solution-shaping skill runs before mob elaboration to decide the shape of the solution — generic capability or feature-specific implementation, expected usage and scale, the simplest viable approach, extend-vs-build-vs-buy, and reversibility. The signed-off decision is recorded on the intent as a `## Solution Shape` section (plus a `Shape:` header field) and inherited by the design session as binding context, so Phase 0 designs within an agreed shape rather than an open field.

It runs **at the developer's discretion** — the engineer decides per intent whether to run it or go straight to elaboration, and skipping is a legitimate choice for work that doesn't need it. Invoke it on intents where the shape isn't obvious — new capabilities, candidate platform features, or requests that may be better served by extending an existing module or adopting an existing service. `mob-elab-prompts.md` **auto-prompts** for it at the start of a session when the intent has no recorded shape, but never runs it without the engineer's go-ahead — so the step is offered, not forced.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/solution-shaping.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/solution-shaping.md`. No customization is needed.

### `skills/design-session.md`

The design-session skill runs as Phase 0 of mob elaboration to establish an agreed design foundation — API contracts, data model sketch, and architectural pattern decisions — before any units are proposed. Mob elaboration inherits the design as binding constraints, so ACs are written against a concrete interface rather than a vague description.

The skill works through three optional areas (API contract, data model, architectural patterns) based on the intent's scope. It produces a `ops/inception/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<unix_timestamp>-[slug]-design.md` artifact and links it back to the intent file. Any new architectural patterns agreed during the session are written to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/architecture.md` as ADRs immediately.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/design-session.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/design-session.md`. No customization is needed — it is called by mob-elab-prompts.md, not invoked separately.

### `skills/uat.md`

The UAT skill runs when all units under an intent are marked Done. It generates a plain-language demo script from the acceptance criteria of every unit under the intent, guides the engineer through a stakeholder validation session, and records the outcome in the intent file's UAT Sign-off section.

The engineer chooses one of three paths: conduct UAT now (the AI walks through the script step by step and records pass/fail per step), defer UAT to a later date (recorded with a revisit date, intent can still close as Implemented), or mark UAT as not required (a reason must be stated). All three choices are recorded. The intent status cannot move to Implemented without a UAT Sign-off entry.

Any UAT failure automatically creates a draft unit in the backlog for the engineer to confirm.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/uat.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/uat.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**UAT skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/uat.md` when all units under an intent are marked Done, or when the engineer invokes it directly. Prompt the engineer to run UAT before setting intent status to Implemented.
```

### `skills/progress-digest.md`

The progress-digest skill generates a plain-language, one-page progress summary for a feature intent — written for non-technical stakeholders (product owners, clients, leadership) who cannot read engineering artifacts. It translates the intent file, bolt status, and unit statuses into a clear picture of what is being built, what is done, and what comes next.

Engineer-triggered at any point during or after delivery of an intent. Produces a single file at `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/inception/intents/[intent-slug]-digest.md`, overwriting any previous digest for that intent. The digest is never archived — it reflects the current state of the intent whenever generated.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/progress-digest.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/progress-digest.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**Progress digest skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/progress-digest.md` when the engineer asks for a stakeholder update, progress summary, or digest for an intent.
```

### `ops/inception/dependency-map.md`

A single file that records which intents depend on which others, and which API contracts, data entities, or shared services cross intent boundaries. Updated automatically by the AI after every elaboration sign-off. Read before every bolt planning step.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/ops/inception/dependency-map.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/inception/dependency-map.md`. It contains the empty table structure and update log — the AI populates it as intents are elaborated.

The AI must read this file before planning a bolt and flag: (1) any prerequisite intent not yet Implemented, (2) any units in the planned bolt that touch a shared interface owned by a different intent.

### `skills/new-engineer-induction.md`

The new-engineer-induction skill runs when an engineer joins an AI-DLC project for the first time. It reads the project's actual master rule file, domain glossary, quality gate, and backlog — then explains each section in plain language, demonstrates the quality gate with a project-specific example, optionally runs a practice elaboration for two units, and produces a personalized quick-reference card written to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/guidelines/[engineer-name-slug]-quick-ref.md`.

The session takes 30–45 minutes. Engineers who want a faster version say "quick tour" to skip the practice elaboration.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/new-engineer-induction.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/new-engineer-induction.md`. No customization is needed — the skill reads the project's own files to personalize the session.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**New engineer induction skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/new-engineer-induction.md` when an engineer says they are new to the project, or invokes it directly.
```

### `skills/knowledge-promotion.md`

The knowledge-promotion skill evaluates each applied improvement to determine whether it is generic (beneficial to all AI-DLC projects) or project-specific. For generic improvements, it drafts the exact change needed in the base repository — file path, current text, and proposed replacement — so the engineer can raise a PR against `ai-dlc-base` without having to reconstruct the context later. The promotion decision and draft are recorded in the improvement file.

Runs automatically as Step 5 of the Post-Retro Improvement Workflow after all improvements are applied. Can also be invoked directly against a specific improvement. A retro is not fully closed until every Applied improvement has a Knowledge Promotion status recorded.

The skill uses the target file as the primary classification signal — files copied verbatim from the base repo (skills, templates, `engagement.md`) are classified generic; files generated per project (code-standards, architecture, domain-glossary, etc.) are classified project-specific. Ambiguous cases are resolved using a content test: would this improvement still apply to a project with a completely different tech stack and domain?

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/knowledge-promotion.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/knowledge-promotion.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**Knowledge promotion skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/knowledge-promotion.md` as Step 5 of the Post-Retro Improvement Workflow, after all improvements are applied. A retro is not closed until every Applied improvement has a Knowledge Promotion status.
```

### `skills/dependency-audit.md`

The dependency-audit skill audits third-party dependencies for major version drift, end-of-life packages, and known vulnerability patterns. It runs in two phases: AI analysis of manifest files using training knowledge, followed by a tool-assisted scan where the engineer runs their ecosystem's security scanner (npm audit, pip-audit, bundler-audit, etc.) and shares the output. Findings are classified by severity and converted into Remediation Bolts in the backlog.

The skill is scheduled — the next audit date is stored in the master rule file Section 9 (Process Configuration). At the start of every session, the AI checks whether the scheduled date has passed and prompts the engineer if so. The engineer may run the audit immediately or defer it to a new date. The recommended cadence is once a month.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/dependency-audit.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/dependency-audit.md`. No customization is needed.

**During onboarding (Step 9 of the Process Configuration section):** ask the engineer when they would like to schedule the first audit and populate the `Next dependency audit` row accordingly.

### `skills/process-health.md`

The process-health skill analyses the project's operational artifacts and produces a quantitative report on how well the AI-DLC process is functioning. It calculates four metrics — improvement adoption rate, quality gate failure rate, AC revision rate, and bolt velocity trend — and surfaces additional decay signals such as retros with no improvements, stale open improvements, and recurring failure patterns.

The report is presented in-conversation and always saved to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/operate/process-health-YYYY-MM-DD.md` automatically. Reports accumulate over time, making it possible to compare health trends across runs.

Recommended cadence: after every third or fourth bolt, or whenever the team suspects the process has drifted.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/process-health.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/process-health.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**Process health skill:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/process-health.md` when the engineer invokes it to audit how well the AI-DLC process is functioning.
```

### `skills/bolt-risk-assessment.md`

The bolt-risk-assessment skill runs after elaboration sign-off and before the first unit in a bolt executes. It actively interrogates each unit for blast radius, cross-unit sequencing risks, rollback feasibility, and feature flag requirements — replacing the passive "Risks and Assumptions" table in the bolt file with structured, engineer-signed-off findings.

For mature projects (those with existing code), this assessment is mandatory before any unit executes. For fresh projects with no existing modules affected, it may be brief but must still be completed.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/bolt-risk-assessment.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/bolt-risk-assessment.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**Bolt risk assessment:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/bolt-risk-assessment.md` after elaboration sign-off and before the first unit in a bolt executes. No unit may begin execution without a signed-off risk assessment in the bolt file.
```

### `skills/bug-bolt.md`

The bug-bolt skill is a lightweight bolt workflow for fixing a specific, reproducible bug. It replaces the full elaboration ceremony with a four-question intake, a recurrence check against retro and incident history, a single focused unit with regression-guard ACs, and a mandatory RCA if the bug is recurring. Skips: design session, dependency map update, mob elaboration. Preserves: pre-generation checks, review checklist, blast radius assessment for shared components, and post-fix retro.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/bug-bolt.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/bug-bolt.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**Bug bolt:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/bug-bolt.md` when the engineer says "fix a bug", "there's a bug in X", or "bug: [description]". Do not run a full mob elaboration — follow the bug bolt workflow directly.
```

---

### `skills/hotfix-bolt.md`

The hotfix-bolt skill is an emergency bolt for production incidents that cannot wait for a planning cycle. It runs a three-question intake (symptom, severity, rollback availability), creates a minimal unit with a two-AC pair (fix applied / no regressions), confirms the blast radius before any code is generated, and mandates a retro and RCA within 24 hours. Skips: elaboration, design session, dependency map update. Preserves: review checklist, pre-generation checks, incident file creation, retro.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/hotfix-bolt.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/hotfix-bolt.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**Hotfix bolt:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/hotfix-bolt.md` when the engineer says "hotfix", "production issue", "prod is down", or "emergency fix for X". Skip elaboration — begin hotfix intake immediately.
```

---

### `skills/nfr-bolt.md`

The nfr-bolt skill handles non-functional quality attribute improvements — performance, security hardening, accessibility, reliability, observability, and scalability. It does not create a new intent; it references and improves existing ones. Key controls: measurable threshold ACs are mandatory (vague ACs are rejected), a before/after measurement is required for bolt closure, affected intents are identified upfront and cross-referenced after completion, and bolt-risk-assessment runs before any unit executes because NFR changes often have wider blast radii than they appear.

Copy this file verbatim from `process-onboarding-agent/skills/nfr-bolt.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/nfr-bolt.md`. No customization is needed.

**Wire into the master rule file Section 6** by adding one routing line:

```markdown
**NFR bolt:** read `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/skills/nfr-bolt.md` when the engineer says "improve performance", "harden security", "accessibility improvements", "NFR bolt for X", or "non-functional work on X". Do not create a new intent — follow the NFR bolt workflow.
```

---

## Step 5 — Write the Guidelines Files

### `guidelines/domain-glossary.md`

Full definitions for every domain term. Each entry: term, definition, usage notes, and related terms. The glossary in the master rule file is a summary — this file is the authoritative source.

### `guidelines/edge-cases.md`

Full descriptions of each known edge case: the scenario, the required behavior, and which parts of the system must handle it. Start with the ones most relevant to your domain. Add entries from retros and incidents.

### `guidelines/acceptance-patterns.md`

Rules for writing good Given/When/Then ACs:
- One behavior per criterion (no compound ACs)
- Name the actor in every Given
- Cover at least one unhappy path per unit
- No implementation details in ACs
- Anti-patterns to avoid (vague outcomes, testing implementation not behavior)


### `guidelines/dev-setup.md`

Step-by-step environment setup for a new engineer:
- All prerequisites with version checks
- Configuration files needed and what goes in them (no actual secrets — explain how to get them)
- How to start each service
- Auth verification steps
- Secrets hygiene checklist

### `guidelines/team-rollout.md`

Covers: git branching conventions, environment isolation, secrets management, backlog ownership, multi-FDE Bolt rhythm, PR checklist, merge conflict resolution (including AI-assisted resolution), team leader review guidelines, and common anti-patterns.

---

## Step 6 — Write the Ops Templates

Each template file defines the structure for its artifact type. The key templates:

### `ops/inception/intents/_template.md`
Fields: Status, Date, Owner, **AI Risk** (Minimal / Limited / High — see template for definitions), What, Why, Success Looks Like, Assumptions, Open Questions, Out of Scope, Elaboration Sessions, Extracted Units, UAT Sign-off, Implementation Summary.

The **AI Risk** field gates the review level required: Minimal → standard review; Limited → named engineer sign-off on ACs before elaboration and on Implementation Summary before merge; High → senior engineer approval before any elaboration begins, plus all Limited controls.

The **Implementation Summary** section is written by the AI once all units under the intent have been delivered and merged. It must not be filled in earlier. It contains four subsections:

1. **What Was Built** — user-facing description of every feature delivered under the intent; one paragraph per distinct feature
2. **How It Works (Key Design Decisions)** — data model choices, API contracts, edge cases explicitly handled, and non-obvious implementation facts a future engineer must know before modifying the feature
3. **Scope Delivered vs. Original Intent** — any deviations from the original intent (descoped items, changed assumptions, additions); write "Delivered as specified" if none
4. **Known Limitations and Future Considerations** — constraints the current implementation imposes on future changes; write "None identified" if none

When the last unit of an intent is confirmed done, the AI must:
1. Set the intent status to **Implemented**
2. Write the Implementation Summary by reading the elaboration session files, unit files, and bolt retros for this intent
3. Ask the engineer to review the summary before closing the intent

The Implementation Summary is the authoritative reference for future Bolts that modify or extend this feature. Any Bolt touching a feature covered by an intent must read its Implementation Summary before elaboration begins.

### `ops/build/units/_template.md`
Fields: Status, Intent link, Elaboration link, Bolt link, Priority, Context, Acceptance Criteria, Scope (in/out), Dependencies, Pre-generation Checks, Edge Cases to Handle, Definition of Done, Prompt Log link, Notes.

The **Pre-generation Checks** section is critical for wrapper/layout units — list grep patterns to run across existing files before generating to surface duplication.

### `ops/build/bolts/_template.md`
Fields: Status, Goal, Start/Target/Completed dates, Units table, Execution Order diagram, Risks & Assumptions, Definition of Done, Retrospective link.

### `ops/operate/retros/_template.md`
Sections: What Went Well, What Didn't Go Well, AI-Specific Observations (prompts that worked / needed revision / quality gate failures / output accepted without enough review), Actions table, Improvements Triggered (**required** — cannot be left blank without a stated reason), New Intents Triggered, Post-Retro Improvement Workflow.

**The Post-Retro Improvement Workflow is mandatory and AI-driven.** Immediately after the retro document is complete, the AI must:
1. Synthesize every finding in "What Didn't Go Well" and "AI-Specific Observations" into concrete improvement proposals — one per finding — identifying the exact file and text to change
2. Present all proposals to the engineer for approval, rejection, or revision before touching any file
3. **For each approved proposal:** check which open or in-progress units reference the section being changed (Pre-generation Checks, ACs, or referenced rule files) and present the impact list to the engineer before applying. Record affected units in the improvement file.
4. For each approved proposal: create an improvement file, apply the change to the target file, and update mirror files if the master rule file was modified
5. Mark each improvement Applied in the retro and close the retro only when all approved improvements are applied

The intent is that every retro automatically tightens the rules, skills, and guidelines that govern the next bolt. No finding should require the engineer to manually translate it into a file change.

### `ops/operate/improvements/_template.md`
Fields: Triggered by (retro/incident link), Target file, Current text, Proposed replacement, Reason, Validation criteria, Status, Applied date.

## Step 7 — Write Instructions2FDE.md

This is the main onboarding document for every engineer. Sections:
1. What AI-DLC is (the loop diagram: Inception → Build → Operate → Improvements)
2. How to invoke each ceremony by talking to the AI (not by following manual steps)
3. What the engineer still owns (review, AC confirmation, running tests, edge case checks)
4. Phase 1 — Inception (how intents and mob elaboration work)
5. Phase 2 — Build (bolts, unit execution order, review before merge)
6. Phase 3 — Operate (retros, incidents, improvements)
7. The Three Non-Negotiables (quality gate, review checklist, prompt log)
8. Using a different AI tool (Cursor → `.cursorrules`; GitHub Copilot → `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
9. Common mistakes table
10. Quick reference table (ceremony → what to say to the AI)

## Step 8 — Confirm Tool Setup and Add Mirror Files

### Primary tool setup

By this point your master rule file should exist at the correct path for your chosen tool (see **Before You Begin**). Verify:

| Tool | Expected path | Loaded automatically? |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` at repo root | Yes — every session |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` at repo root | Yes — every session |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Yes — every session |

### Supporting multiple tools in the same repo

If your team uses more than one AI tool, create copies of the master rule file for each additional tool. The content is identical — only the file name, location, and internal link prefixes differ.

**Add Cursor support** (if your primary tool is Claude Code or Copilot):
```bash
cp CLAUDE.md .cursorrules
```
Open `.cursorrules` and update the opening line to reference Cursor.

**Add GitHub Copilot support** (if your primary tool is Claude Code or Cursor):
```bash
mkdir -p .github
cp CLAUDE.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```
Open `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, update the opening line to reference GitHub Copilot, and change all `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/` link prefixes to `../{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/`.

**Add Claude Code support** (if your primary tool is Cursor or Copilot):
```bash
cp .cursorrules CLAUDE.md   # or copy from .github/copilot-instructions.md
```
Open `CLAUDE.md`, update the opening line to reference Claude Code, and if copying from Copilot change all `../{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/` prefixes back to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/`.

### Sync discipline

Whenever the master rule file is updated, all mirror files must be updated in the same PR. Add this to your PR checklist — it is a team discipline, not an automated process.

---

## Step 9 — Initialize the Backlog and First Intent

1. Copy `process-onboarding-agent/ops/build/backlog.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/build/backlog.md` — it already contains the empty status sections and the Reference Link Registry comment at the bottom.
2. Copy `process-onboarding-agent/ops/inception/dependency-map.md` to `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/ops/inception/dependency-map.md` — it contains the empty map structure and update log.
3. Identify the first capability to build and write an intent: `ops/inception/intents/YYYY-MM-DD-<unix_timestamp>-<slug>.md`
4. Say to your AI assistant: "Run a mob elaboration for the [intent name] intent"
5. After sign-off, the AI creates unit files, updates the backlog, and updates the dependency map. **When adding any unit or bolt to the backlog, the AI must use reference-style links** — write the display text as `[Unit-name][unit-slug]` in the table and add the path definition to the Reference Link Registry at the bottom of the file. Never use inline URLs in backlog tables.
6. Say: "Plan a bolt from the open units in the backlog" — before creating the bolt file, the AI reads `ops/inception/dependency-map.md` and flags any prerequisite intents that are not yet Implemented, or any units that touch a shared interface owned by a different intent.
7. Say: "Execute unit [name] from bolt [name]"

## What Makes This Work

The quality of the framework depends entirely on two things:

**1. The specificity of the master rule file.** Generic rules produce generic output. The more your master rule file encodes your actual domain language, your actual architectural decisions, and your actual learned anti-patterns, the better every AI interaction will be. A master rule file written on day one will be much weaker than one shaped by three bolts of retros.

**2. The discipline of the retro loop.** The retro is the compiler for the process. Every failure that is not encoded into a rule will recur. Every retro that produces no improvement file means the next bolt starts from the same baseline. Run the retro after every bolt, file the improvements, and the framework compounds.

## Onboarding Completion — What the Agent Must Produce

When the agent has finished executing this guide, it must output a structured completion report before handing back to the engineer. The report must contain:

### 1. Files Created
A table of every file written during onboarding, grouped by folder.

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (or tool equivalent) | Created | Sections 1–8 populated |
| `{FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/rules/...` | Created | … |
| *(etc.)* | | |

### 2. Sections Requiring Engineer Review
List every section or field in the master rule file that the agent could not populate from the codebase and left as a placeholder. The engineer must fill these before the first Bolt runs.

### 3. Open Questions
Any ambiguity the agent encountered that the engineer must resolve — e.g., conflicting patterns found in the codebase, modules where ownership was unclear, or test coverage below the gate threshold.

### 4. First Recommended Action
One sentence: what the engineer should do next before starting the experience agent (e.g., "Review the domain glossary placeholders in Section 4 of the master rule file, then start a new session to begin the first mob elaboration.").

### 5. How to Start the Experience Agent

This is the final and mandatory step. After the report is presented, the agent must say:

---

> **Onboarding is complete. The experience agent is now embedded in your `[master rule file name]`.**
>
> **This session is now finished. Do not continue working in this conversation.** The onboarding session has accumulated context — interview answers, archaeology findings, file creation history — that is no longer needed and will slow down and distort future AI sessions.
>
> **To start the experience agent:**
> 1. Close or end this conversation entirely.
> 2. Open a brand new session inside your project repository using your AI tool ([Claude Code / Cursor / GitHub Copilot]).
> 3. Your AI tool will automatically load `[master rule file path]` at the start of the session.
> 4. Say: **"[first action from item 4 above]"**
>
> From that point forward, every session in this repository is an experience agent session. The onboarding agent is not needed again unless you are onboarding a new project.

---

> The agent must not mark onboarding as complete until all checklist items below are checked and this report — including the handoff instruction — has been presented to the engineer.
