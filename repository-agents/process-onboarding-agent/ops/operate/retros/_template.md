## Post-Retro Improvement Workflow

> **The AI must execute this workflow immediately after the retro document is complete. Do not wait for the engineer to initiate it.**

### Step 1 — Synthesise findings into improvement proposals

Read every entry in "What Didn't Go Well", "AI-Specific Observations", and "Actions". For each finding that points to a fixable rule, skill, or guideline, draft one improvement proposal covering:
- Which file needs to change (`process-onboarding-agent/rules/`, `process-onboarding-agent/skills/`, `process-onboarding-agent/guidelines/`, or the master rule file)
- The exact current text to replace (or "new addition" if nothing exists yet)
- The exact proposed replacement text
- Why the change prevents the finding from recurring

Present all proposals to the engineer as a numbered list — one proposal per finding — before creating any files.

### Step 2 — Engineer review

For each proposal, the engineer approves, rejects, or asks for revision. Record the decision next to each item. Do not proceed to Step 2.5 until all proposals have a decision.

### Step 2.5 — Rule change impact check

For each **approved** improvement, check whether any currently open units or planned bolts will be affected by the rule change before applying it.

1. Read `process-onboarding-agent/ops/build/backlog.md` and identify all units with status **Open** or **In Progress**.
2. For each open unit, check whether its Pre-generation Checks, ACs, or referenced rule files mention the section or pattern the improvement will change.
3. For planned or in-progress bolts, check whether any units that have not yet executed reference the section being changed.
4. Present the impact list to the engineer:

   > "Before I apply this change, [N] open units reference the section being modified: [unit names]. Their pre-generation checks or ACs may need updating after the improvement is applied. Do you want me to flag these units for review once the change is made?"

5. Record the impact list in the improvement file under **Affected open units** (see improvement template). If no open units are affected, record "None."

Do not proceed to Step 3 until the engineer has acknowledged the impact list.

### Step 3 — Create improvement files and apply changes

For each approved proposal:
1. Create an improvement file at `ops/operate/improvements/YYYY-MM-DD-<unix_timestamp>-[slug].md` using the template
2. Apply the change directly to the target file
3. If the master rule file was changed, update all mirror files in the same pass (see Step 8 of the setup guide)
4. Set the improvement status to **Applied** and record the date

### Step 4 — Update this retro

Update the "Improvements Triggered" table above with the improvement file links and mark each as Applied or Rejected. Close the retro only after all approved improvements are applied.

### Step 5 — Knowledge Promotion Evaluation

After all improvements are applied, read `process-onboarding-agent/skills/knowledge-promotion.md` and run it against every improvement marked Applied in this retro. This step evaluates whether each improvement is generic enough to benefit all AI-DLC projects and should be contributed back to the base repository.

**This step is mandatory and must not be skipped.** A retro is not fully closed until every Applied improvement has a `Knowledge Promotion` status recorded in its improvement file — even if that status is "Project-specific."
