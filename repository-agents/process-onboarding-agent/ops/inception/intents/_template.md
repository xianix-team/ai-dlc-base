# Intent: [Name]

**Status:** Draft | Ready | In Elaboration | Elaborated | In Progress | Implemented | Deferred | Cancelled
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Engineer name]
**AI Risk:** Minimal | Limited | High

> **AI Risk definitions:**
> - **Minimal** — feature does not process personal data, make automated decisions affecting users, or operate in a safety-critical context. Standard review applies.
> - **Limited** — feature processes personal data, influences user-visible outcomes through AI, or integrates with external AI services. Requires named engineer sign-off on ACs before elaboration begins and on the Implementation Summary before merge.
> - **High** — feature makes or directly influences automated decisions with significant user impact (financial, medical, access control, legal), or processes sensitive categories of personal data. Requires senior engineer approval on the intent before any elaboration begins, plus all Limited controls.

## What

[One paragraph describing what this capability is. Written from the user's perspective — what they can do, not how the system does it.]

## Why

[Why does this matter? What problem does it solve or what opportunity does it capture? Include any business or user context.]

## Success Looks Like

[Describe the observable outcome when this intent is fully delivered. Not technical metrics — describe what is true for the user or business.]

## Assumptions

- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

## Open Questions

- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

## Out of Scope

- [Thing explicitly not included]

## Extracted Units

| Unit | Status | Bolt |

## UAT Sign-off

> **Complete this section before setting the intent status to Implemented.** Run `process-onboarding-agent/skills/uat.md` when all units are Done. The engineer may choose to conduct UAT now, defer it, or waive it — all three choices are recorded here.

**Status:** Pending | Passed | Passed with findings | Failed | Deferred | Not required

## Implementation Summary

> **Complete this section when all units under this intent have been delivered and merged. Do not fill it in until the intent status is set to Implemented.**

### What Was Built

[Describe the features delivered under this intent from the user's perspective — what they can now do that they could not before. Write one paragraph per distinct feature if the intent contained multiple. Do not describe implementation details.]

### How It Works (Key Design Decisions)

[Explain the key design decisions made during elaboration and build that a future engineer must understand before modifying this feature. Include: data model choices, API contract decisions, edge cases that were explicitly handled, and anything non-obvious about the implementation.]

### Scope Delivered vs. Original Intent

[State any deviations from the original intent: features descoped, assumptions that changed, or out-of-scope items that were included. If the implementation matches the intent exactly, write "Delivered as specified."]

### Known Limitations and Future Considerations

[List anything deliberately left out that may need to be addressed later, or constraints the current implementation imposes on future changes. If none, write "None identified."]

### Bolts That Delivered This Intent

| Bolt | Completed | Retro |
|---|---|---|
