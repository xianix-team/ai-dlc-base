## AI-DLC Reviewer (Diagnostics)

The `repository-agents/process-diagnostic-agent/` folder provides a **pull** mode audit that works at any stage — whether the project is fully onboarded, partially adopted, or has no installation of the 99x Intent Delivery Framework at all. The agent works with whatever process artifacts the team already has and scores them against AI-DLC principles, making it equally useful as a pre-onboarding readiness assessment or a periodic health check on a running project.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `repository-agents/process-diagnostic-agent/role-play.md` | Bootstrap trigger. Copy into the target repo and read it to the AI to start a review session. |
| `repository-agents/process-diagnostic-agent/review-guide.md` | Full review protocol — eight domains, rubrics for every artifact type, scoring system, and report format. |

## How to Use

1. Copy the `process-diagnostic-agent/` folder from `repository-agents/` in this repo into the root of the project repo being audited.
2. Open your AI assistant inside that repo.
3. Say: `"Read process-diagnostic-agent/role-play.md and follow the instructions inside it."`
4. The AI adopts the reviewer persona and runs through the selected review domains — requesting artifacts or conducting conversations per domain, scoring against rubrics, and delivering a comprehensive report with gap analysis, a People-Process-Tools Alignment section, and a prioritised remediation plan.

The reviewer never asks for files by specific path — the engineer shares whatever they have from wherever they keep it. For teams without AI-DLC installed, that means sharing current-process artifacts (tickets, PRs, retro notes) and the agent scores those against AI-DLC principles. The resulting gap report is a practical brief for an onboarding session.

The reviewer never generates code or creates files unprompted. It is a diagnostic tool, not an onboarding tool.

## Review Scope

The session begins with a scope selection step. Process review always runs; People and Tools are optional.

**Always included (6 domains):**
1. **Foundation** — master rule file structure and completeness
2. **Inception** — intent and elaboration session quality
3. **Build** — unit and bolt file quality
4. **Operate** — retro, improvement, and RCA discipline
5. **Process Adherence** — quality gate enforcement and review usage, conversation-based
6. **Organization & Structure** — assessed passively from the locations you provide artifacts from

**Optional (selected at session start):**
7. **People** — Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) skills assessment across five capability areas, conversation-based. Choose one team member or several — the agent assesses each individually and compiles a team aggregate.
8. **Tools** — SDLC automation posture across nine pipeline stages, conversation-based; produces a classified automation tier table with gap challenges and suggestions.

## Review Output

The agent delivers a comprehensive Review Report written to a dated file in your `diagnostics-reports/` folder. The report contains:

- **Review Scorecard** — domain-by-domain scores (Aligned / Partially Aligned / Not Aligned / Skipped)
- **Findings** — every finding by severity (Critical → Important → Advisory), each with the observed gap, the principle it violates, and the specific change recommended
- **Organization Assessment** — scored across five dimensions
- **People-Process-Tools Alignment** — FDE skills profile (People), process adherence summary (Process), and SDLC automation posture table (Tools); skipped sections noted
- **Gap Analysis** — table mapping each finding to the AI-DLC principle it violates, with current state, target state, and severity
- **Trend Analysis** — domain score timeline across all past reviews, finding classifications (New / Recurring / Resolved / Worsened), and a trajectory summary (or first-review baseline if no prior reports exist)
- **Remediation Plan** — Immediate / Short-term / Long-term actions (produced only when Critical or Important findings exist), each with the exact change required and a verification signal
- **First Action** — the single highest-impact change from the Immediate tier
- **Patterns Worth Monitoring** — recurring themes that did not reach Critical severity but signal process drift

## Running a Pre-Onboarding Assessment

The diagnostics agent works equally well before AI-DLC is installed. Share your current process artifacts — Jira tickets, PR descriptions, retro notes, incident records, or anything that represents how your team currently works — and the agent scores them against AI-DLC principles.

The resulting gap report tells you exactly what is missing and why, and becomes the brief for your onboarding session. It is a faster path to a high-quality onboarding than starting from scratch.

You do not need to copy `process-onboarding-agent/` for this — the diagnostics agent never reads from it. The resulting gap report is a practical brief for a 99x Intent Delivery Framework onboarding session if the team decides to proceed.
