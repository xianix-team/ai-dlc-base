## What Is This Repository?

This repo is the **base template** — the source of truth that gets copied into each project repo. It contains:

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/setup-guide.md` | The complete framework specification. Describes every file, rule, and ceremony. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/onboard.md` | The bootstrap trigger. Drop this into a target repo and follow the instructions to start onboarding. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/compact-docs.md` | Engineer-triggered skill to archive operational documents older than the project's configured threshold. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/root-cause-analysis.md` | Skill to run 5-Whys analysis on incidents and improvements, classify root causes (Solution Design / Technology / Process), surface cross-cutting patterns, and produce linked intent or improvement artifacts. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/solution-shaping.md` | Pre-elaboration solution shaping. Decides generic vs feature-specific scope, expected usage, the simplest viable approach, extend-vs-build-vs-buy, and reversibility before any design work; records the signed-off shape on the intent as binding context for the design session. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/design-session.md` | Phase 0 of mob elaboration. Runs at the start of every elaboration session to lock down API contracts, data models, and architectural patterns before unit decomposition begins. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/bolt-risk-assessment.md` | Pre-bolt risk assessment. Analyzes blast radius, cross-unit sequencing risks, rollback options, and feature flag requirements before the first unit executes. Mandatory for mature projects. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/progress-digest.md` | Stakeholder communication artifact. Translates technical progress (units, bolts, statuses) into plain-language summaries for non-technical stakeholders. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/uat.md` | Acceptance testing protocol. Guides the engineer through UAT using the intent's ACs as the test script; records pass/fail/deferred outcomes; blocks intent from being marked Implemented without sign-off. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/process-health.md` | Process health metrics. Computes four metrics (improvement adoption, quality gate failure rate, AC revision rate, bolt velocity) and surfaces decay signals; saves a dated health report automatically. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/dependency-audit.md` | Monthly dependency and security posture audit. Reads manifests, classifies findings by severity, and creates remediation bolts for high/critical issues. Scheduled via Section 9 of the master rule file. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/knowledge-promotion.md` | Cross-project learning protocol. Runs as the final step of every retro; classifies each improvement as generic (to be contributed back to this base repo) or project-specific. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/new-engineer-induction.md` | New engineer onboarding session. Walks a new team member through the project's framework using actual project files; produces a personalized quick-reference card. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/bug-bolt.md` | Lightweight bolt workflow for fixing a specific, reproducible bug. Triggered by "fix a bug in X". Skips design session and elaboration; replaces them with a four-question intake, recurrence check, and a single focused unit. Runs RCA automatically if the bug is recurring. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/hotfix-bolt.md` | Emergency bolt for production incidents. Triggered by "hotfix" or "prod is down". Runs a three-question intake (symptom, severity, rollback), creates a minimal unit, mandates a retro and RCA within 24 hours. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/skills/nfr-bolt.md` | Non-functional quality attribute bolt. Triggered by "improve performance of X", "NFR bolt for X", etc. Requires a measurable threshold AC, establishes a before/after baseline, and cross-references affected intents. Does not create a new intent. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/inception/dependency-map.md` | Intent dependency map. Records which intents depend on others and which interfaces are shared across intent boundaries; read before bolt planning, updated after every elaboration sign-off. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/rules/engagement.md` | Engineer engagement monitoring — signals of disengagement, intervention script, and escalation protocol. Copied verbatim into every project. |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/inception/intents/_template.md` | Template for writing a feature intent (includes Implementation Summary section, written when all units under the intent are delivered) |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/inception/elaborations/_template.md` | Template for logging a mob elaboration session |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/build/units/_template.md` | Template for an atomic unit of work |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/build/bolts/_template.md` | Template for a planned batch of units |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/build/backlog.md` | Starter backlog file with Reference Link Registry — all unit/bolt links use reference-style Markdown so compact-docs only updates the registry, never the table rows |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/operate/retros/_template.md` | Template for a bolt retrospective (includes Post-Retro Improvement Workflow — AI-driven, runs immediately after every retro) |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/operate/incidents/_template.md` | Template for a production incident |
| `repository-agents/process-onboarding-agent/ops/operate/improvements/_template.md` | Template for a process improvement triggered by a retro or incident |

The remaining files (most of `rules/`, all of `guidelines/`, and the master rule file) are **generated per project** by the AI agent during onboarding — they cannot be shared across projects because they encode each project's specific stack, domain, and conventions.

## What the Agent Creates in Your Project Repo

The onboarding agent first asks where your process documentation lives, then installs the framework at `{your-docs-folder}/intent-execution-framework/` (or `docs/process/intent-execution-framework/` if no folder exists yet). After onboarding, your target repo will contain:

```
<your-project>/
  CLAUDE.md (or .cursorrules / .github/copilot-instructions.md)
  process-onboarding-agent/        ← delete this after onboarding is complete
    onboard.md

  {your-docs-folder}/              ← e.g. docs/process/ or an existing docs folder
